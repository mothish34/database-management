Introduction
A Student Management System (SMS) is a crucial tool for educational institutions to efficiently manage student-related information. This mini-project is a database-driven application developed using Python and MySQL, aimed at automating student record management. The project provides an interactive interface to store, retrieve, update, and delete student data seamlessly.

Project Overview
This Student Management System is designed to handle basic operations such as adding new students, updating records, retrieving student details, and deleting records if needed. Python serves as the front-end language, while MySQL acts as the back-end database management system.

Features
1. Student Registration:
Allows adding new students with details like Name, Roll Number, Class, Age, and Contact Information.
Validates input to ensure no duplicate roll numbers.
2. Student Information Retrieval:
Fetches student details based on Roll Number, Name, or Class.
Displays all stored student records in a tabular format.
3. Update Student Records:
Modifies existing student details such as name, contact, or class.
Ensures data consistency and integrity.
4. Delete Student Records:
Provides an option to remove students who are no longer part of the institution.
Prevents accidental deletion through confirmation prompts.
5. User Authentication (Optional Enhancement):
Adds a security layer to restrict access to authorized users only.
